# 🧠 Build an AI Agent in Python

This project is based on the **[Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev)** course: [Build an AI Agent in Python](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-ai-agent-python). 
It walks through building a simple AI agent from scratch using Python, with an emphasis on modular, testable code.

# IMPORTANT NOTICE

This project does NOT have all the security and safety features that a production AI agent would have. It is for learning purposes only. Use at your own risk.

## 🚀 What It Does

The AI agent is designed to perform tasks like:

- Parsing natural language input
- Executing tasks based on interpreted commands
- Storing and retrieving information from a memory-like structure
- Using basic reasoning to complete objectives

This project is educational and showcases how AI agents work at a conceptual level.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+
- `unittest` for unit testing
- Command-line interface (CLI) tools (bash, git)
- Built-in Python libraries + Google's Gemini API

## 📁 Project Structure
[TBD]
